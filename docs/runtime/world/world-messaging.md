# Messaging

For an introduction what a message is and how it fits into the overall picture, see [The World / Scenegraph System](world-overview.md).

This documentation focuses on the C++ `ezMessage` class. The functionality exposed through other mechanisms, such as [TypeScript (TODO)](../../custom-code/typescript/typescript-overview.md), may be more limited in scope, but ultimately maps to the C++ implementation.
